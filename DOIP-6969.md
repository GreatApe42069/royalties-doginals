# Doginals Optimization & Improvement Proposal to Update Doginals.js for Royalties and Enforcement of Royalties

## Introduction

This proposal addresses the need for automatic royalty enforcement in the `Doginals.js` script by explaining the limitations of Dogecoin's current scripting capabilities and suggesting a solution for community-wide adoption. Dogecoin, like Bitcoin, doesn't natively support smart contract functionality or advanced transaction logic required for royalty enforcement using its existing OP codes. However, by using `OP_RETURN` and community-wide adoption of the updated `Doginals.js` script, we can implement off-chain royalty enforcement.

**This proposal will explain:**

- Why Dogecoin's OP codes can't handle royalties at the protocol level.

- How OP_RETURN allows us to store and retrieve royalty data.

- Why it’s crucial for all Doginals participants, marketplaces, and indexers to update their scripts.

- A potential future solution via a Dogecoin protocol soft fork to add royalty-enforcing OP codes.

## Why Dogecoin’s Current OP Codes Don’t Support Royalties:

Dogecoin uses the same basic scripting system as Bitcoin, which includes simple OP codes that govern how transactions are validated. However, this scripting system is Turing incomplete and is not capable of executing complex transaction logic like:

- Calculating a royalty percentage from a transaction.

- Automatically transferring royalties to a creator or owner during future transfers.


The current OP code system is primarily designed for:

- Signature verification (e.g., `OP_CHECKSIG`).

- Multisig transactions.

- Time locks (e.g., `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`).


While Dogecoin scripts can store royalty data in an inscription via `OP_RETURN`, they cannot enforce royalty payments on future transfers. This is because Dogecoin scripts are stateless and don’t track or execute complex logic based on past transactions.

## Proposed Solution: `OP_RETURN` + Off-Chain Royalty Enforcement
**How `OP_RETURN` Helps**
In `Doginals.js`, we can store royalty information (e.g., recipient address, royalty percentage) as part of the inscription data using `OP_RETURN`. `OP_RETURN` allows you to include arbitrary data in a transaction, which becomes (immutable and stored on-chain). This makes it possible to:

- Store royalty metadata on-chain.

- Retrieve the royalty information when the inscription is transferred or sold in the future.

However, storing the data is only half the solution. Enforcing the royalties will require the `Doginals.js` script to be updated across the entire community. The script will:

- Read the royalty information from the inscription.

- Automatically calculate the royalty when the inscription is transferred.

- Send the royalty payment to the designated recipient.

This off-chain solution is necessary because Dogecoin’s protocol doesn’t support dynamic calculations or automatic fund transfers on future transactions.

Why?

Wwll, ideally for Blockchain-Based Royalty Enforcement you would have to enforce royalties at the protocol level, you would need a smart contract platform (like Ethereum), which can execute logic (such as calculating and transferring royalties) automatically as part of every transaction.

Since Dogecoin and Bitcoin don't natively support smart contracts, off-chain tools (like Doginals) are needed to read, interpret, and enforce royalty rules.

## How will Royalty Retrieval Works in this Doginals script:

1. Doginals Script: The script you are using (the Doginals code) is responsible for retrieving the inscription from the blockchain, checking if it has royalty data, and then enforcing those rules.

- The royalty data (e.g., recipient, percentage/amount) is stored as part of the inscription data on-chain when the inscription is minted.

-Future transfers of the inscription need to use a script or application (like Doginals) that:

- Reads the inscription data from the blockchain.

- Identifies the royalty metadata (e.g., recipient, percentage).

- Automatically calculates and sends the royalty as part of the transfer.


***Example of How Doginals Script Retrieves Royalty Data in the current script:***

- When transferring an inscription, the script retrieves the inscription data and looks for royalty information stored as part of the inscription.


**This logic is in the transferInscription function:**

(`javascript`)

async function transferInscription(inscriptionId, newOwnerAddress, transferAmount) {
    // Retrieve the inscription and its associated royalty data
    let inscription = getInscriptionById(inscriptionId); // Assume this fetches the inscription
    let royaltyData = inscription.royalty; // Get the stored royalty information

    // Check if royalty data exists
    if (royaltyData) {
        // Calculate and enforce royalty...
    }
}


**Indexing and Retrieval**
The Doginals script must index and retrieve inscription data from the blockchain. It looks for any royalty data stored in the inscription and applies the logic.
If others do not have this updated code, they won’t retrieve or enforce the royalty data, meaning royalties may not be paid when they transfer the inscription.


**How `Doginals.js` Enforces Royalties**
In the updated `Doginals.js` script:

1. When an inscription is minted, royalty data (e.g., recipient and percentage) is stored via `OP_RETURN`.

2. When the inscription is transferred or sold, the updated script:

- Retrieves the royalty data from the inscription.

- Calculates the royalty based on the transfer amount.

- Automatically sends the royalty amount to the creator or designated recipient.

- Transfers the remaining balance to the new owner.

However, this approach only works if everyone involved in the Doginals community, including marketplaces and indexers, updates their scripts to support this functionality. If only one participant (e.g., you) uses the updated script, royalties will not be enforced in other transactions.

## Why Community-Wide Adoption and Updating Script is Essential

For this solution to work, it’s critical that every member of the Doginals community adopts the updated `Doginals.js` script. 

***Here’s why:***
If only you have the updated script that enforces royalties, it will only work for transfers that go through your version of the Doginals code. However, if others transfer the inscription using an older or different version of the Doginals code (which doesn't include royalty enforcement), the royalty will not be applied.

- Royalty enforcement depends on the script that reads and interprets the `OP_RETURN` data. If some participants (e.g., marketplaces or other users) use older versions of the script, they won’t enforce royalties when an inscription is transferred or sold.

- If the entire community adopts the updated Doginals script, everyone involved in transfers or transactions will follow the same rules.

- This would mean that anyone who transfers the inscription would automatically trigger the royalty logic, ensuring that royalties are paid every time an inscription is transferred.

- This relies on community consensus and adoption of the updated code.

- Without community-wide adoption, royalties will only be enforced in some transactions, which undermines the whole purpose of this system.

- Marketplaces and indexers need to adopt the updated script to ensure that all transfers involving inscriptions properly account for royalties.

**What Happens if Not Everyone Updates?**
- If only a few members or marketplaces adopt the updated script, royalties will not be enforced in transactions that go through participants using outdated scripts.

- This means that creators will not receive royalties unless the buyer/seller/marketplace uses the updated `Doginals.js` script.

## A Potential Future Solution: Adding Royalty OP Codes to `Dogecoin Core`

While the off-chain `OP_RETURN` solution is currently the best approach, an ideal solution would be to modify the Dogecoin protocol to support smart contract-like functionality, allowing royalties to be enforced on-chain without relying on external scripts. This would require a soft fork to add new OP codes and capabilities to Dogecoin’s scripting language.

**Example: Custom OP Codes for Royalty Enforcement**
Here’s an example of how new OP codes might look if we were to add royalty enforcement natively in Dogecoin:

***(.cpp)

// Royalty opcodes
const OP_DUP = Opcode.OP_DUP;
const OP_TOALTSTACK = Opcode.OP_TOALTSTACK;
const OP_HASH160 = Opcode.OP_HASH160;
const OP_EQUALVERIFY = Opcode.OP_EQUALVERIFY;
const OP_FROMALTSTACK = Opcode.OP_FROMALTSTACK;
const OP_PUSHNUM3 = Opcode.OP_PUSHNUM3;
const OP_PUSHNUM100 = Opcode.OP_PUSHNUM100;
const OP_DIV = Opcode.OP_DIV;
const OP_CHECKSIG = Opcode.OP_CHECKSIG;

// Dogecoin Script for verifying a royalty payment
`OP_DUP`                // Duplicate the top stack item (the value to transfer)
`OP_TOALTSTACK`         // Move a copy to the alternative stack for later use
`OP_HASH160`            // Hash the top item on the stack (recipient address)
<Creator's PubKeyHash> // Push the creator's public key hash onto the stack
`OP_EQUALVERIFY`        // Continue only if the hash matches the expected creator's address hash
`OP_FROMALTSTACK`       // Retrieve the transaction value from the alternative stack
`OP_PUSHNUM3`           // Push the number 3 onto the stack
`OP_PUSHNUM100`         // Push the number 100 onto the stack
`OP_DIV`                // Divide the top two items (calculate 3% of the transaction value)
`OP_EQUALVERIFY`        // Verify that the amount equals 3% of the total transaction value
`OP_CHECKSIG`           // Check the signature to ensure the transaction is authorized***


This custom OP code script would enforce a 3% royalty to the creator during any transaction that involves a specific inscription, directly at the protocol level.

**Challenges with This Approach**

- Soft Fork: Introducing new OP codes would require a soft fork of the Dogecoin network. This means Dogecoin Core would need to update its scripting language, and miners would have to adopt the changes.

- Community Consensus: Such a proposal would need to go through the Dogecoin Core development process and be approved by the broader community.

- Resistance to Change: Given the current stance of some Dogecoin Core developers towards Doginals and inscriptions, it’s likely that there would be resistance to this proposal.

If the Dogecoin Core developers don’t accept the proposal, the new changes to Dogecoin Cores OP codes would only be usable by developers who adopt the changes in their own custom Dogecoin clients, which fragments the network and user base.

##Conclusion

1. Short-Term Solution: The `Doginals.js` script can use `OP_RETURN` to store royalty data and enforce it through community-wide adoption. This solution requires all Doginals participants, marketplaces, and indexers to update their scripts.

2. Long-Term Solution: A protocol-level change to Dogecoin Core (via a soft fork) could introduce new OP codes to natively enforce royalties, but this would require community consensus and approval by the Dogecoin Core developers, which is uncertain.

*To ensure royalty enforcement, either the entire community needs to use the updated Doginals script or another mechanism (like a marketplace or service) must be used to ensure royalties are always applied. Otherwise, the on-chain inscription itself cannot enforce royalties without external scripts like Doginals*

##Call to Action

- Update the `Doginals.js` script to support off-chain royalty enforcement via `OP_RETURN`

- Ensure that all community members, marketplaces, and indexers adopt the updated script to enforce royalties consistently across the network.

- Explore the potential for a future Dogecoin protocol update to add native royalty enforcement through new OP codes.
