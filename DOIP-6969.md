# Doginals Optimization & Improvement Proposal to Update Doginals.js for Royalties and Enforcement of Royalties

## Introduction

This proposal addresses the need for automatic royalty enforcement in the `Doginals.js` script by explaining the limitations of Dogecoin's current scripting capabilities and suggesting a solution for community-wide adoption. Dogecoin, like Bitcoin, doesn't natively support smart contract functionality or advanced transaction logic required for royalty enforcement using its existing OP codes. However, by using `OP_RETURN` and community-wide adoption of the updated `Doginals.js` script, we can implement off-chain royalty enforcement.

**This proposal will explain:**

- Why Dogecoin's OP codes can't handle royalties at the protocol level.

- How OP_RETURN allows us to store and retrieve royalty data.

- Why it’s crucial for all Doginals participants, marketplaces, and indexers to update their scripts.

- A potential future solution via a Dogecoin protocol soft fork to add royalty-enforcing OP codes.

## Why Dogecoin’s Current OP Codes Don’t Support Royalties:

Dogecoin uses the same basic scripting system as Bitcoin, which includes simple OP codes that govern how transactions are validated. However, this scripting system is Turing incomplete and is not capable of executing complex transaction logic like:

- Calculating a royalty percentage from a transaction.

- Automatically transferring royalties to a creator or owner during future transfers.


The current OP code system is primarily designed for:

- Signature verification (e.g., `OP_CHECKSIG`).

- Multisig transactions.

- Time locks (e.g., `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`).


While Dogecoin scripts can store royalty data in an inscription via `OP_RETURN`, they cannot enforce royalty payments on future transfers. This is because Dogecoin scripts are stateless and don’t track or execute complex logic based on past transactions.

## Proposed Solution: `OP_RETURN` + Off-Chain Royalty Enforcement
**How `OP_RETURN` Helps**
In `Doginals.js`, we can store royalty information (e.g., recipient address, royalty percentage) as part of the inscription data using `OP_RETURN`. `OP_RETURN` allows you to include arbitrary data in a transaction, which becomes (immutable and stored on-chain). This makes it possible to:

- Store royalty metadata on-chain.

- Retrieve the royalty information when the inscription is transferred or sold in the future.

However, storing the data is only half the solution. Enforcing the royalties will require the `Doginals.js` script to be updated across the entire community. The script will:

- Read the royalty information from the inscription.

- Automatically calculate the royalty when the inscription is transferred.

- Send the royalty payment to the designated recipient.

This off-chain solution is necessary because Dogecoin’s protocol doesn’t support dynamic calculations or automatic fund transfers on future transactions.

Why?

Wwll, ideally for Blockchain-Based Royalty Enforcement you would have to enforce royalties at the protocol level, you would need a smart contract platform (like Ethereum), which can execute logic (such as calculating and transferring royalties) automatically as part of every transaction.

Since Dogecoin and Bitcoin don't natively support smart contracts, off-chain tools (like Doginals) are needed to read, interpret, and enforce royalty rules.

## How will Royalty Retrieval Works in this Doginals script:

1. Doginals Script: The script you are using (the Doginals code) is responsible for retrieving the inscription from the blockchain, checking if it has royalty data, and then enforcing those rules.

- The royalty data (e.g., recipient, percentage/amount) is stored as part of the inscription data on-chain when the inscription is minted.

-Future transfers of the inscription need to use a script or application (like Doginals) that:

- Reads the inscription data from the blockchain.

- Identifies the royalty metadata (e.g., recipient, percentage).

- Automatically calculates and sends the royalty as part of the transfer.


***Example of How Doginals Script Retrieves Royalty Data in the current script:***

- When transferring an inscription, the script retrieves the inscription data and looks for royalty information stored as part of the inscription.


**This logic is in the transferInscription function:**

(`javascript`)

async function transferInscription(inscriptionId, newOwnerAddress, transferAmount) {
    // Retrieve the inscription and its associated royalty data
    let inscription = getInscriptionById(inscriptionId); // Assume this fetches the inscription
    let royaltyData = inscription.royalty; // Get the stored royalty information

    // Check if royalty data exists
    if (royaltyData) {
        // Calculate and enforce royalty...
    }
}


**Indexing and Retrieval**
The Doginals script must index and retrieve inscription data from the blockchain. It looks for any royalty data stored in the inscription and applies the logic.
If others do not have this updated code, they won’t retrieve or enforce the royalty data, meaning royalties may not be paid when they transfer the inscription.


**How `Doginals.js` Enforces Royalties**
In the updated `Doginals.js` script:

1. When an inscription is minted, royalty data (e.g., recipient and percentage) is stored via `OP_RETURN`.

2. When the inscription is transferred or sold, the updated script:

- Retrieves the royalty data from the inscription.

- Calculates the royalty based on the transfer amount.

- Automatically sends the royalty amount to the creator or designated recipient.

- Transfers the remaining balance to the new owner.

However, this approach only works if everyone involved in the Doginals community, including marketplaces and indexers, updates their scripts to support this functionality. If only one participant (e.g., you) uses the updated script, royalties will not be enforced in other transactions.

## Why Community-Wide Adoption and Updating Script is Essential

For this solution to work, it’s critical that every member of the Doginals community adopts the updated `Doginals.js` script. 

***Here’s why:***
If only you have the updated script that enforces royalties, it will only work for transfers that go through your version of the Doginals code. However, if others transfer the inscription using an older or different version of the Doginals code (which doesn't include royalty enforcement), the royalty will not be applied.

- Royalty enforcement depends on the script that reads and interprets the `OP_RETURN` data. If some participants (e.g., marketplaces or other users) use older versions of the script, they won’t enforce royalties when an inscription is transferred or sold.

- If the entire community adopts the updated Doginals script, everyone involved in transfers or transactions will follow the same rules.

- This would mean that anyone who transfers the inscription would automatically trigger the royalty logic, ensuring that royalties are paid every time an inscription is transferred.

- This relies on community consensus and adoption of the updated code.

- Without community-wide adoption, royalties will only be enforced in some transactions, which undermines the whole purpose of this system.

- Marketplaces and indexers need to adopt the updated script to ensure that all transfers involving inscriptions properly account for royalties.

**What Happens if Not Everyone Updates?**
- If only a few members or marketplaces adopt the updated script, royalties will not be enforced in transactions that go through participants using outdated scripts.

- This means that creators will not receive royalties unless the buyer/seller/marketplace uses the updated `Doginals.js` script.

## A Potential Future Solution: Adding Royalty OP Codes to `Dogecoin Core`

While the off-chain `OP_RETURN` solution is currently the best approach, an ideal solution would be to modify the Dogecoin protocol to support smart contract-like functionality, allowing royalties to be enforced on-chain without relying on external scripts. This would require a soft fork to add new OP codes and capabilities to Dogecoin’s scripting language.

**Example: Custom OP Codes for Royalty Enforcement**
Here’s an example of how new OP codes might look if we were to add royalty enforcement natively in Dogecoin:

***(.cpp)

// Royalty opcodes
const OP_DUP = Opcode.OP_DUP;
const OP_TOALTSTACK = Opcode.OP_TOALTSTACK;
const OP_HASH160 = Opcode.OP_HASH160;
const OP_EQUALVERIFY = Opcode.OP_EQUALVERIFY;
const OP_FROMALTSTACK = Opcode.OP_FROMALTSTACK;
const OP_PUSHNUM3 = Opcode.OP_PUSHNUM3;
const OP_PUSHNUM100 = Opcode.OP_PUSHNUM100;
const OP_DIV = Opcode.OP_DIV;
const OP_CHECKSIG = Opcode.OP_CHECKSIG;

// Dogecoin Script for verifying a royalty payment
`OP_DUP`                // Duplicate the top stack item (the value to transfer)
`OP_TOALTSTACK`         // Move a copy to the alternative stack for later use
`OP_HASH160`            // Hash the top item on the stack (recipient address)
<Creator's PubKeyHash> // Push the creator's public key hash onto the stack
`OP_EQUALVERIFY`        // Continue only if the hash matches the expected creator's address hash
`OP_FROMALTSTACK`       // Retrieve the transaction value from the alternative stack
`OP_PUSHNUM3`           // Push the number 3 onto the stack
`OP_PUSHNUM100`         // Push the number 100 onto the stack
`OP_DIV`                // Divide the top two items (calculate 3% of the transaction value)
`OP_EQUALVERIFY`        // Verify that the amount equals 3% of the total transaction value
`OP_CHECKSIG`           // Check the signature to ensure the transaction is authorized***


This custom OP code script would enforce a 3% royalty to the creator during any transaction that involves a specific inscription, directly at the protocol level.

**Challenges with This Approach**

- Soft Fork: Introducing new OP codes would require a soft fork of the Dogecoin network. This means Dogecoin Core would need to update its scripting language, and miners would have to adopt the changes.

- Community Consensus: Such a proposal would need to go through the Dogecoin Core development process and be approved by the broader community.

- Resistance to Change: Given the current stance of some Dogecoin Core developers towards Doginals and inscriptions, it’s likely that there would be resistance to this proposal.

If the Dogecoin Core developers don’t accept the proposal, the new changes to Dogecoin Cores OP codes would only be usable by developers who adopt the changes in their own custom Dogecoin clients, which fragments the network and user base.

## Conclusion

1. Short-Term Solution: The `Doginals.js` script can use `OP_RETURN` to store royalty data and enforce it through community-wide adoption. This solution requires all Doginals participants, marketplaces, and indexers to update their scripts.

2. Long-Term Solution: A protocol-level change to Dogecoin Core (via a soft fork) could introduce new OP codes to natively enforce royalties, but this would require community consensus and approval by the Dogecoin Core developers, which is uncertain.

*To ensure royalty enforcement, either the entire community needs to use the updated Doginals script or another mechanism (like a marketplace or service) must be used to ensure royalties are always applied. Otherwise, the on-chain inscription itself cannot enforce royalties without external scripts like Doginals*

## Extra Thoughts & Notes:

Here's how it works as of now:

Royalty Calculation:

The script checks if there is royalty data associated with the inscription being transferred.If royalty data exists, it calculates the royalty amount based on whether it's a percentage or flat amount.

Sending Royalty:

The calculated royalty amount is sent to the royalty recipient.

Remaining Amount to the Seller:

After sending the royalty, the remaining amount (which is the total transfer amount minus the royalty) is sent to the new owner (newOwnerAddress).The code correctly sends the remaining amount to the new owner's address (not to the buyer)

Code Logic:
javascript

if (royaltyData) { let royaltyAmount = 0; if (royaltyData.isPercentage) { royaltyAmount = Math.floor(transferAmount * (royaltyData.amount / 100)); } else { royaltyAmount = royaltyData.amount; } // Send the royalty amount to the royalty recipient await sendTransaction(royaltyData.recipient, royaltyAmount); // Send the remaining amount to the new owner let remainingAmount = transferAmount - royaltyAmount; await sendTransaction(newOwnerAddress, remainingAmount); } else { // If no royalty, transfer full amount await sendTransaction(newOwnerAddress, transferAmount); } 

What Happens If there is royalty data: The royalty is calculated and sent to the royalty recipient. The remaining amount (after the royalty is subtracted) is sent to the new owner (or seller, depending on the transaction context).If there is no royalty:The full transfer amount is sent to the new owner.

Correct Flow:
-Buyer pays 100 DOGE. 
-10 DOGE (10%) goes to the royalty recipient (artist).
- 90 DOGE goes to the seller (the address transferring the inscription).

### Conclusion thus far:

I think the script is correctly structured to send the remaining DOGE to the seller's address after the royalty has been deducted, ensuring the buyer pays the full amount, the artist gets their royalty, and the seller gets the balance.

As of now i think the code accurately captures how the transferInscription command works, including how royalties are handled.

Royalty Minting Logic:

The current draft script encodes royalty data (either percentage or flat) during the minting process:

javascript

if (royaltyRecipient && royaltyAmount) { let royaltyData = { recipient: royaltyRecipient, amount: finalRoyaltyAmount, isPercentage: isPercentage }; // Append royalty data to the inscription data = Buffer.concat([data, Buffer.from(royaltyHex, 'hex')]); } 

This part handles royalty encoding during the minting process, which is right.

2. Transfer Logic:

In the transferInscription function:

javascript


// Enforce royalty during transfer let royaltyData = inscription.royalty; if (royaltyData) { let royaltyAmount = 0; if (royaltyData.isPercentage) { royaltyAmount = Math.floor(transferAmount * (royaltyData.amount / 100)); } else { royaltyAmount = royaltyData.amount; } await sendTransaction(royaltyData.recipient, royaltyAmount); let remainingAmount = transferAmount - royaltyAmount; await sendTransaction(newOwnerAddress, remainingAmount); } else { await sendTransaction(newOwnerAddress, transferAmount); } 

This logic seems to correctly send royalties to the royalty recipient and the remaining amount to the new owner (buyer). NOTE: The newOwnerAddress is the address receiving the DOGE after the royalty is deducted, which is appropriate in a transfer context. (AS PER CHATGPT)

3. Marketplace Compatibility:

We need to confirm the following for marketplace compatibility:

How royalties are calculated on the marketplace:

Can the marketplace adjust their code to their script to calculate royalties as a percentage or fixed amount when a sale is made? When royalties are encoded as percentage, or f it’s a flat amount, we need to ensure that the marketplace enforces that royalty amount in the same way our script does.

Handling Transfer After Sale: When an inscription is transferred, the marketplace  needs to ensure royalties are still respected. Our script seems to correctly enforce royalties during transfers, but we might need to ensure that the marketplace interface supports it in the same way (i.e., the marketplace might need to track that the royalty recipient is paid upon transfer). 

Payment Flow in the Marketplace: During buying and selling, we need to ensure that the payment for royalties flows through the same mechanism as our script. The marketplace may have additional checks or interfaces for payments, so we need to verify that the payment structure matches.

What we need to Double-Check in the Marketplace Docs:

Sale Process: Does the marketplace require a specific method or endpoint for transferring funds (now including royalties)? This is crucial to ensure that the payment is routed correctly.

Transfer Method: Does the marketplace handle transfers through an API or a transaction script? Ensure that our transferInscription method fits with how the marketplace expects transfers to occur.

### Next Steps:

Locate and check any specific excerpts or commands from the marketplace documentation publicly available regarding how they handle listing, buying, selling, and transferring, we can refine our script further to ensure compatibility with all.

Let me explain the reasoning behind using newOwnerAddress in the context of the transfer and clarify the logic. Might need to be changed upon testing to ensure flows correct.


Why newOwnerAddress?

In the script, the newOwnerAddress refers to the recipient of the inscription — the person or entity that will own the inscription after the transfer. It represents the party that will take over the ownership of the Doginal after the transfer is complete.

In the context of this transfer:

Seller/Owner: This is the person or entity who currently owns the inscription and is transferring it to another party.Buyer/NewOwner: This is the person or entity receiving the inscription and will become the new owner of it after the transfer.

The reason we use newOwnerAddress in the transfer logic is because the new owner (or buyer) is the one who receives the transfer of ownership. The seller (old owner) is the one transferring the inscription, but they are not the ones receiving DOGE in the transfer process, they send it.


What is happening in the transfer:

The new owner (the buyer) pays the amount to acquire the inscription.The script then calculates royalties, sends the royalty portion to the artist (if applicable), and sends the remaining amount to the seller.

In other words, newOwnerAddress is the address that receives the remaining DOGE after the royalty is deducted. But this doesn't imply that the "new owner" is the one transferring the inscription — rather, the new owner is the one receiving the inscription as part of the transfer process.

Breaking it down in the context of the script:

Seller (the current owner) is transferring the inscription. The buyer/new owner is receiving the inscription. If royalty is involved, the royalty is paid to the artist. The remaining DOGE (after royalties) is sent to the seller (the current owner).

Key Clarification:The term newOwnerAddress is about the receiving party, i.e., the one who will own the inscription after the transfer. The script sends the balance (after royalties) to the seller. So, in essence, the "new owner" gets the inscription, but the "seller" receives the balance of the payment.

This is why, logically, the script uses newOwnerAddress for the party receiving the payment, and the seller/old owner is the one transferring the inscription and receiving the remaining DOGE. (Very Confusing code might need altering)

### Summary: 
newOwnerAddress: The address receiving the remaining DOGE after royalty deduction, and becoming the new owner of the inscription.

Seller: The address transferring the inscription and receiving the balance.

### Correct Flow:

Buyer pays 100 DOGE.

10 DOGE (10%) goes to the royalty recipient (artist).

90 DOGE goes to the seller (the address transferring the inscription).

***I also think if we can successfully get royalty encoding to work it will work for Collection metadata as well removing the need for submitting all that shit to marketplaces and have the entire metadata including traits encoded into the inscription***

We would have to fine tune an create logic for doginalsData as well as update the Marketplaces logic

### EXAMPLE HOW ROYALTY IS ENCODING:

let royaltyData = { recipient: royaltyRecipient, amount: finalRoyaltyAmount, isPercentage: isPercentage }; // Append royalty data to the inscription data = Buffer.concat([data, Buffer.from(royaltyHex, 'hex')]); }

### CURRENT DOGINALS COLLECTION METADATA ENCODING LOGIC: (example might need adjusting)

let doginalsData = {collection: collectionName, description: collectionDescription, name: inscriptionName; supply: supply; uri: imageURI; floor: floorPrice; socialX: xLink; discord: discordLink; website: websiteLink; github: github; youtube: youtube; date: collectionCreationTimestamp; artist: artistName, }; // Append doginals data to the inscription data = Buffer.concat([data, Buffer.from(doginalsHex, 'hex')]); }

### UPDATED MARKETPLACE LOGIC EXAMPLE:

import axios from 'axios'

const MARKETPLACE_BACKEND_API = import.meta.env.VITE_MARKETPLACE_BACKEND_API || 'https://marketplace-api.dogeord.io/'

type LetDoginalsData = {
  collectionName: string
  collectionDescription: string
  inscriptionName: string
  minInscriptionNumber: string
  maxInscriptionNumber: string
  inscriptionDescription: string
  supply: number
  imageURI: string
  floorPrice: string
  royaltyRecipient: string
  finalRoyaltyAmount: string
  xLink: string
  discordLink: string
  websiteLink: string
  github: string
  youtube: string
  collectionCreationTimestamp: string
  artistName: string
  sales: number
  totalVolume: number
  totalListed: number
  holders: number
  activity: number
  visible?: boolean
}


# Call to Action

- Work on Updating and Adoption of Update within the `Doginals.js` Protocol to support off-chain Royalty enforcement via `OP_RETURN` and possibly Collection Metadata

- Ensure that all community members, marketplaces, and indexers adopt the updated script to enforce royalties, and parse the data correctly, and consistently across the network.

- Explore the potential for a future Dogecoin protocol update to add native royalty enforcement through new OP codes.
